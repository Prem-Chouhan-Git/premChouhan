This is project 1 "Product Sales Insights".

What I have been given:
- Project specification which outlines:
    A clear business question to answer. 
    A mark breakdown for each section (SQL, R, and reporting).
- Flexibilty on how I build the models, one per product or a combined model.
- Guidance on feature creation, interpretation, and recommendations. 

What I need to do:
- Use SQL to prepare dataset.
- Use R for modelling and visualisations.
- Store and submit my work using GitHub.

Tips:
- Prioritise interpretability over complexity.
- Can compare multiple models, like linear regression vs decsion trees.
- Ensure recomendations are practical and product specific.
- Keep Github organised with clear file names and folder structure.
